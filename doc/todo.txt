Nc: Things to be done
=====================

Here is a list of things that should be done, sorted by descending priority.

No-return Functions
-------------------
One should compute the set of no-return functions (or basic blocks, or addresses) and use this information when building the control-flow graph of the whole program, namely, chop basic blocks after no-return function calls.

ARM
---
Support for ARM architecture is wanted.
A prototype is available in the `arm` branch.
Needed: more descriptions of instructions, description of the calling convention, testing.

x86 Floating-Point Arithmetic
-----------------------------
Needed: descriptions of floating-point instructions.
Idea: implement pushes and pops from/to FPU stack as a sequence of assignments, e.g.: `st(7)=st(6), st(6)=st(5), ..., st(1) = st(0)`.
Might be a bit much of code, but it is much better than tracking the FPU stack pointer value (that may come different from different branches).
Will require more clever code generation concerning elimination of unnecessary copies.
Will require support for floating types in `likec`.

[[SessionSaving]]
Session Saving
--------------
One should be able to store a session and reopen it, with all decompilation results being there.

Session Saving in IDA
---------------------
One should restore windows in IDA on reopening the project.
Depends on <<SessionSaving>>.

Refactoring
-----------
Currently, it is unclear how to remember the names given by the user and reuse them in further decompilations.
Related to this topic: changing calling convention by the user.

Eliminating Term Access Types
-----------------------------
Term access types should go: they are not some property of a term.

Pass Manager
------------
`MasterAnalyzer` should eventually become a `PassManager`.
